# DetectLPWithPy
Detection and Recognition of License Plates of Moving Vehicles using Python
    Learning Python by designing an ANPR system. It demonstrates the usage of OpenCV,tensorFlow tools, pytesseract (OCR tool). The system needs to be calibrated a little to achieve accuracy. The currently put videos are calibrated with an accuracies ranging from 79%-100%. Be sure to calibrate for your video of moving vehicles.
    The code is executable, and has no bugs now. Execute the shell "execShell", all other useful modules are called by the same; That being said, change the path names according to your system environment before executing.
    Use it, share a better version, have fun!
